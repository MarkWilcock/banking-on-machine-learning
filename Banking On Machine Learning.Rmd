## The beginning of the end?
### The hackathon is towards the end of a firm's journey into ML

Compare your hackathon experience with tales from recent meetup talks from successful data scientists

- Alice Daish of British Museum, a data scientist without data! "communication & empathy"
- John Kelly of North Yorks County Council, "talk to CEO like to mum"

But big sophisticated banks are different, right?

## Anatomy of a big bank - and its IT

- Global: high cost (LON, NY) & low cost (Pune, Portugal & Poland)
- Large: ~50K FTE  
- Diversifed: retail bank (in historic home), investment bank (trading rates, equities & FX), private bank, and bad bank

Data and analytics are not of fundamental importance in the same way as they are for Microsoft, Bloomberg,... - or a ML startup.

Sophisticated IT - but perhaps not the most conducive to transformational ML?

- historically viewed as a necessary cost of doing business, not a differentiator (factory model)
- many (most) projects related  reporting to regulators
- effort on reducing legacy applications
- overriding focus on reliable operational capacity



## For banks, ML is both opportunity and threat
### Traditional strengths have become modern weaknesses

Case study: 10X, led by Anthony Jenkins, ex CEO of Barclays (Bottom Line, BBC Radio 4, 16th March 2017)  
"10 times better for customers, bank, and society"  
"intelligent use of data"  

* Threats
    + disintermediation (startups cherry pick FX, peer-to-peer lending...)
    + regulations e.g. PSD2 eroding natural advantages 
  
* Opportunities 
    + front office revenue; pricing, client relationship, e.g. robo-advisors
    + reduce costs in swollen back offices
    + reduce credit & operational risk management

Fintech = **ML** + blockchain + crowdsourcing + robotic process automation


## The banks' ML strategy

Externally - from competition to collaboration with start-ups

- Incubate! 
- Invest! 
- Engage!
- Assimilate!

Internally - raise awareness, mobilise, crowdsource ideas and spin up initial projects

1. Exhort and educate. "Adapt Or Die" at the Town Hall pep talk
2. Mobilise. Appoint ML Czars, crowd-source ideas, instigate proof of value (PoV) projects, run hackathons...
3. Pick proof of concepts (PoC). (5 minutes of fame)
4. Run PoCs. Agree sponsors, budgets, assign PMs + teams
5. _to do:_ Embed ML into bank's culture and operations


## Advice from a ML Czar (& Top 30 AI Influencer)
### Dr Andy Pardoe heads the ML stream at a Swiss Bank.

- firms building a community of data scientists
- informal network: look for projects and activity outside own area
- cherry pick highly manual & repetitve processes
- popular: reccommender systems for reconciling adjustments / breaks
- do a proof of _value_ (PoV) before the proof of concept (PoC)
- ML projects are business transformation projects
- users need to gain confidence -> often a long UAT / production parallel


## My 5 minute proof of value demo
### You're the CIO. Is this a winner or loser?

- Background: RFQs (request for quotes) market making of financial instruments
- Process: counterparty requests quotes for bond (say), we provide bid-offer, counterparty states intent to buy or sell
- Challenge: Predict counterparty intent based on details of client, product, transaction time
- Opportunity: better pricing: any slight edge better than 50:50 will be profitable

## The data:  product, counterparty, date, outcome

## The machine learns.

It analyses the history, make predictions. This simple decision tree model explains its reasoning.  Other  models do not but may achieve better results.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(ROCR)
library(rattle)
library(xtable)
library(htmlTable)
library(knitr)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- read.csv(file = "Quote Data.csv", header = TRUE)
df <- mutate(df, tempval = runif(nrow(df)))
df.train <- filter(df, tempval <= 0.7) %>% select(-tempval)
df.test <- filter(df, tempval > 0.7) %>% select(-tempval)

decision.tree.model <-
  rpart(BuySell ~ TimeOfDay + IsEndOfWeek + IsEndOfMonth +
          CounterpartyCountry + CounterpartySector + 
          + BondCountry + BondTenor,
        data = df.train,
        method = "class")
fancyRpartPlot(decision.tree.model, cex = 0.6)
```

### Anything better than a diagonal line from bottom left to top right confers business benefit.
```{r, echo = FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
decision.tree.prediction <-
    predict(decision.tree.model, df.test, type = "class")

df.test <- mutate(df.test, BuySell.dtree = decision.tree.prediction)

# count of true positives  - can go further to vcalculate  accuracy  etc manually
count.tp <- nrow(filter(df.test, BuySell == 'Buy' & BuySell.dtree == 'Buy'))
count.fp <- nrow(filter(df.test, BuySell == 'Sell' & BuySell.dtree == 'Buy'))
count.fn <- nrow(filter(df.test, BuySell == 'Buy' & BuySell.dtree == 'Sell'))
count.tn <- nrow(filter(df.test, BuySell == 'Sell' & BuySell.dtree == 'Sell'))
count.all <- nrow(df.test)

accuracy <- (count.tp + count.tn) / count.all

logit.model <-
  glm(BuySell ~ TimeOfDay + IsEndOfWeek + IsEndOfMonth + 
        BondCountry + BondTenor + 
        CounterpartyCountry +  CounterpartySector,
      data= df.train,
      family = binomial(link='logit'))

logit.prediction <- predict (logit.model, df.test, type='response')

df.test <- mutate(df.test, BuySell.logit = ifelse(logit.prediction <= .5, 'Buy', 'Sell'))

count.tp.logit <- nrow(filter(df.test,  BuySell=='Buy' & BuySell.logit=='Buy'))
count.fp.logit <- nrow(filter(df.test,  BuySell=='Sell' & BuySell.logit=='Buy'))
count.fn.logit <- nrow(filter(df.test,  BuySell=='Buy' & BuySell.logit=='Sell'))
count.tn.logit <- nrow(filter(df.test,  BuySell=='Sell' & BuySell.logit=='Sell'))

accuracy.logit <- (count.tp.logit + count.tn.logit) / count.all

pred <- prediction(logit.prediction, df.test$BuySell)

perf <- performance(pred, measure="tpr", x.measure = "fpr")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
options(repr.plot.width = 5, repr.plot.height = 3)
plot(perf, col = rainbow(10), main = "Model performance")
```

## What's your verdict?

- Winner. This will get funding for a proof of concept.
- Loser. It is unlikely to generate profitable business because...? 


## Conclusion

### Successful introduction of ML into an organisation is about communication, culture, change, marketing... and finally hard data science.
